# Project overview and purpose
- This page helps the user to easily create a structured shopping list to use in foreign countries. 

# Features and functionality
- Individual products can be entered into the list, with many different information fields.
- Any number of additional products can be added to the list. 
- The list can be filtered by Item Category, Year and Price. 
- The list can also be exported in JSON, CSV, TXT, or to the clipboard.

# Known issues or limitations
- No data persistence
- No way to get data onto the page without manually entering it
- The first entry in the list cannot be removed. 

# Future enhancement ideas
- File uploading. Allow the site to accept any of its four export formats to build a list. This could also add the imported list items onto any existing entries.
- Reordering the list. The list currently only sorts by entry order. A custom ordering number field, or a drag handle could be used.
- Compact view. The SPA only has one mode â€“ editing. This can get cluttered quickly with larger lists, so a view mode could be added to make it easier to see the list without constant scrolling.
