# Overview
- This project is a single page application that demonstrates basic HTML and Javascript functionality.

# Functionality
- The page has a text entry field, and a text output field. Putting any string into the entry field will make the Javascript embedded in the HTML file perform a factorial on the number of characters in the string, showing the total number of possible combinations of strings that can be made with only the provided characters. 

# Choices and Challenges
- The Javascript was originally in a separate, dedicated file. Due to the low omplexity and scale of the project, I decided to move all of the JS to be embedded in the HTML file.
- Initially, the page was going to output all of the possible word recombinations. This proved to be more complex would have a very lengthy output, so the function of the page was changed, as described in the above section.
